## Introducing:

This software is used to simplify ClamAV usage and automatize detect verification using Metadefender service.

Scope:
* Reduce number of false-positive detection;
* Simplify user interface;
* Provide less overloaded detection reports.

Usage cases:
* Manual or scheduled virus-scanning;
* Simple IP-abuse scanning.

Limitations:
* Number of Metadefender scans are limited by one's API key. Free API key is limited to 10 scans per day.


## Tutorial:

Installation guide is described in **INSTALL.md** file.
Application does not require any special workspace preparations.

To get help use:
```
python3 envy_sec.py --help
python3 envy_sec.py -h
```

To perform file scan:
```
python3 envy_sec.py -S path/to/file/to/be/scann.ed
python envy_sec.py --scan-file C:\PathTo\File\ToBeScann.ed
```

To perform IP scan:
```
python3 envy_sec.py --scan-ip 8.8.8.8
python3 envy_sec.py -I 8.8.8.0\24
```

To perform ClamAV signatures update:
```
python3 envy_sec.py --update
python3 envy_sec.py -U
```

To send multiple arguments use space:
```
python3 envy_sec.py -I 8.8.8.8 9.9.9.9
```

Commands also might be combined:
```
python3 envy_sec.py --update -I 8.8.8.8 9.9.9.9 -F ./eicar.virus /some/another/file
```

Command execution priority:
1. Update;
2. Scan IP;
3. Scan file;


## API reference:

## Developer documentation:

This section describes how exactly does secEnvyronment works (or does not). 

Briefly, how does it work:
- User invoke—ã secEnvyronment scan,
- secEnvyronment open ClamAV subprocess, 
- and put all ClamAV output in queue,
- in parallel, thread (work_thread) checks for new lines in queue,
- and if thread finds something, it sends it to Metadefender,
- then prints out approved or denied result.

<pre>
                Approve or deny ClamAV detection,
                         output results.

### Metadefender Errors:

1. HTTP code is HTTP status code, used to control HTTP session status 
   (like if server work or not, connection refused and etc.);
2. Response code placed in response JSON, used to control Metadefender session status
   (like data validity, API key limits and etc.);
3. Description is a response code explanation;
   (like why this happened);
